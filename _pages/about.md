## Research Areas

### 1) LLM-enabled Scientific Collaboration
We build identity-grounded agents and workflows to support cross-disciplinary ideation, synthesis, and collaboration.

### 2) Urban Mobility & Geospatial Intelligence
We develop scalable pipelines for transit analytics, incident understanding, and spatiotemporal modeling for cities.

### 3) Scholarly Intelligence & Research Trajectories
We analyze author-level trajectories using OpenAlex/S2, embeddings, concept graphs, and interactive apps.
